        <br/><br/>
        Our initial state is always a 2-dimensional Gaussian wavepacket 
        centered at some $\mathbf{r}_0$, with width $\sigma$ and average momentum $\mathbf{k}$:
        $${ 
            \psi(\mathbf{r},0) = N \, e^{-(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_0})^2 / 2\sigma^2} \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \; , \tag{1}
        }$$
        
        where $N$ is a normalization constant. 
        <br/><br/>

        This state evolves in time according to the Schr&#246;dinger equation, 
        
        $${ 
                i {\partial\psi(\mathbf{r},t)\over \partial t} = H \psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left( -{\nabla^2 \over 2m} + V(\mathbf{r})\right) {\psi(\mathbf{r},t) \; .} \tag{2}
        }$$
        
        Here, $H$ is the Hamiltonian, $V$ is the potential energy function, $m$ is the particle mass, and we are using units in which Planck’s constant ℏ is equal to 1.

        <br/><br/>
        Equation (2) can be solved numerically by discretizing the wavefunction in both space and time: We suppose that $\psi$ lives on a rectangular grid with spacing $a$,
        so that the Laplacian operator gets replaced by a discrete approximation, 
        
        $${\begin{aligned} 
        \nabla^2\psi \equiv \left({\partial^2 \over \partial x^2} + {\partial^2 \over \partial y^2}\right)\psi \rightarrow {1 \over a^2} \Bigl(
                                 &\psi(\mathbf{r}+a\hat{\mathbf{x}}, t)  -2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + \psi(\mathbf{r}-a\hat{\mathbf{x}}, t) \; + \\
                                 &\psi(\mathbf{r}+a\hat{\mathbf{y}}, t)  -2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + \psi(\mathbf{r}-a\hat{\mathbf{y}}, t) \Bigr) \; ,
        \end{aligned}\tag{3}
        }$$

        and we also suppose that time advances in discrete steps of size $\Delta t$, so that the time derivative in (2) becomes
        
        $${ 
            {\psi(\mathbf{r}, t + \Delta t) - \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \over \Delta t } \;.  \tag{4}
        }$$
        
        If we sample the initial wavefunction (1) onto the grid, we can use equation (4) iteratively to 
        compute &nbsp;$\psi(\mathbf{r}, \Delta t)$, &nbsp;$\psi(\mathbf{r}, 2\Delta t)$, &nbsp;$\psi(\mathbf{r}, 3\Delta t),$ and so on.
        <br/><br/>

        This procedure works and is accurate so long as $\Delta t$ and $a$ are chosen small enough. 
        (In the limit as these quantities approach zero, the discrete results approach the continuum solution arbitrarily closely.)
        However, there are refinements that produce more accurate results when $\Delta t$ and $a$ are finite.

        One such refinement is Visscher's algorithm <a href="#footnote-1">[Ref. 1]</a>. 
        Visscher noted that if you split the wavefunction into its real and imaginary parts, $\psi = R + iI$, the Schr&#246;dinger equation is equivalent to
       
        $${
            {\partial R \over \partial t} = H I \, , \quad \text{and} \quad {\partial I \over \partial t} = -H  R \, . \tag{5}
        }$$
       
        If you further specify that $R$ and $I$ are defined at staggered times, $R$ at $\{0,\,$ $\Delta t,\,$ $2\Delta t,\,...\,\}$, and
        $I$ at $\{\Delta t/2\,$, $3\Delta t/2\,...\,\}$, then the discretized version of (5) is
       
        $${\begin{aligned} 
                R(t + \Delta t/2) &= R(t - \Delta t/2) + \Delta t \, H\,I(t) \; ,\\
                I(t + \Delta t/2) &= I(t - \Delta t/2) - \Delta t \, H\,R(t) \,.
        \end{aligned}\tag{6}
        }$$

        Why go to all this extra trouble? Because it can be shown that the system (6) is <br/>
            <div style="height:0.35em;"></div>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (i) accurate to second order in $\Delta t$ (whereas equation (4) is only accurate to first order), <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (ii) unitary, <i>i.e.</i>, probability is conserved at each step, and <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (iii) stable for a wide range $\Delta t$'s.
        
        <br/><br/>
        Regarding that last point, many numerical algorithms, including forward iteration based on equation (4), are unstable. 
        That is, the errors grow exponentially with the number of time steps until they completely swamp the solution. 
        The video below shows what this can look like in practice.

        </div>
        <br/><br/>

        A second refinement to the basic algorithm is the use of a higher-order formula for the discrete second derivative:
        $${
        {   \partial^2\psi \over \partial x^2} \rightarrow {1 \over a^2}\left(
            -{1 \over 12} \psi(\mathbf{r} + 2a\hat{\mathbf{x}}) + {4 \over  3} \psi(\mathbf{r} +  a\hat{\mathbf{x}}) - {5 \over 2}\psi(\mathbf{r}) 
            +{4 \over  3} \psi(\mathbf{r} -  a\hat{\mathbf{x}}) - {1 \over 12} \psi(\mathbf{r} - 2a\hat{\mathbf{x}}) \right) \; ,
            \tag{7}
        }$$ 
        and similarly for $\partial^2\psi / \partial y^2$.
        This is accurate to fourth order in $a$, versus second order for equation (3). (See reference <a href="#footnote-2">[Ref 2]</a>.)
        Thus it allows us to create accurate simulations with larger grid spacings, and hence fewer grid points.

        <br/><br/>
        Up till now, we have avoided the question of what happens to the wavefunction at the grid boundaries. 
        Evolving the wavefunction with no special treatment of the boundaries is equivalent to placing infinitely high potential barriers there, because the wavefunction
        is implicitly zero just outside the grid. This results in unwanted reflections, which interfere with the scattering phenomena we're trying to visualize.
        Figure 2 illustrates the problem.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>        

        To address this problem, we introduce an imaginary-valued potential in the border region of the grid.
        This potential effectively "absorbs" the wavefunction (<i>i.e.</i>, damps it exponentially ) rather than reflecting it. 
        The results are illustrated in figures 3 and 4.

        Most of the computational work is done in the compute shaders. (The file names are
